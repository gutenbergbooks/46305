<h2 id="c1"><br /><span class="small">Start your glorious western vacation at GALLATIN GATEWAY INN</span></h2>
<p>Composed in equal parts of natural beauty,
mystery and fascination, Yellowstone Park has
long taken rank as one of America&rsquo;s and the
world&rsquo;s show places. Recently it has entertained
as many as a million visitors in a single summer.</p>
<p>Now <i>you</i> are planning a Yellowstone vacation.
We propose, in this booklet, to give you
a foretaste of the wonders that lie ahead. To
show you some of the advantages of entering
the Park via the scenic Gallatin Gateway, and
to suggest the entertainment possibilities of a
few extra days spent at Gallatin Gateway Inn.</p>
<p>Gallatin Gateway Inn lies about thirty-five
miles south of Three Forks, Montana, on the
mainline of The Milwaukee Road. The Inn was
built by the Railroad and is now privately
operated for the convenience of Yellowstone
passengers as well as for the entertainment of
guests who wish to stay over for a short time.</p>
<p>Of modified Spanish design, the hospitable
Inn is surrounded by the green, irrigated meadows
of the lovely Gallatin valley. In the background
rise the timber-clad mountains of the
Bridger, Gallatin and Madison ranges of the
Montana Rockies.</p>
<p>At its elevation of almost 5,000 feet, the
climate is ideal throughout the summer months.
There is a high percentage of bright, sunny
days yet it is always cool enough at night to
enjoy the comfort of woolen blankets.</p>
<p>Passengers for Yellowstone on The Milwaukee
Road&rsquo;s COLUMBIAN taking regular Park
tours have only an hour or two at the Inn.
However, passengers on the new Olympian
HIAWATHA arrive at the Inn in mid-afternoon
and do not ordinarily leave for the Park
till next day after lunch. With a knowledge of
the Inn and its facilities, you can plan to take
fullest advantage of your time there. And, of
course, you may decide to extend your stay.</p>
<p>Set in wide lawns and gardens, Gallatin Gateway
Inn is a delightfully comfortable place. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
has bright, airy bedrooms, a spacious two-story
living room, a sun-lit dining room and the
friendly Corral cocktail lounge. The food is procured
from the Inn&rsquo;s own gardens, from nearby
farms and ranches, and from markets along
the route of The Milwaukee Road. Prepared
by skilled chefs and expertly served, it is guaranteed
to be just right for the hearty appetites
generated by mountain air.</p>

<p>Your genial host at Gallatin Gateway Inn
combines a full understanding of hotel operation
with an intimate knowledge of the surrounding
country. His staff takes pride in seeing that
you enjoy every minute of your stay.</p>
<p>On your way to or from Yellowstone, a few
days at the Inn will prove a pleasant interlude.
You can spend those days in quiet loafing, in
active sports, or in making exploratory trips.</p>
<p>The swift flowing Gallatin river offers fine
trout fishing just a short walk from the door.
Archery, clock golf and tennis may be enjoyed
right on the spacious grounds. Whatever you
do you&rsquo;ll like the comfort and the congenial
atmosphere of Gallatin Gateway Inn.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><br /><span class="small">OFF TO YELLOWSTONE</span></h2>
<p>Chance turned the footsteps of the first white
man toward Yellowstone. In 1807, John Colter,
a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition,
was wounded in an Indian battle near Jackson
Hole. In escaping, he journeyed northward and
penetrated Yellowstone as far as what is now
known as Tower Falls.</p>
<p>More than twenty years later, Jim Bridger, a
famous frontier guide, also entered the region
that had come to be known as &ldquo;Colter&rsquo;s Hell&rdquo;
and verified the fantastic tales of his predecessor.
But even then, no one accepted the
story. Colter and Bridger were in the position
of Marco Polo who had discovered an empire
so strange that its very existence was doubted.</p>
<p>Not until 1870, when a public exploring party
made a thorough study of the region, were its
wonders accepted as fact. Then, action quickly
followed. In 1872 a bill was introduced before
congress and speedily passed, that established
Yellowstone as the first of our National Parks.
A vast rectangle of 3,438 square miles lying in
the northwest corner of Wyoming and overlapping
into Montana and Idaho, Yellowstone
is a broad, volcanic plateau with an average
elevation of 8,000 feet, and with mountain peaks
in and around the park rising as high as ten
and twelve thousand feet ... more than two
million enchanted acres with the greatest and
most varied array of wonders in all the earth.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="Luggage and cars." width="500" height="629" />
</div>
<p>But all this is recent history. Take a brief
look at the amazing past of Yellowstone. Millions
of years ago, the present high plateau
was a parched, arid plain sheltered behind the
buttresses of the continent&rsquo;s two great mountain
ranges&mdash;Appalachia in the East and Cascadia
in the West. Slowly, the land sank and
Yellowstone was buried a hundred fathoms deep
under the arctic waters of the Sundance Sea. As
the invading waters retreated, a shift in temperature
changed Yellowstone into a huge subtropical
marsh where giant dinosaurs drowsed
and fed in the green half-light that filtered down
through jungle trees.</p>
<p>The next great geologic change saw Yellowstone
thrust skyward by the slow buckling of
earth&rsquo;s crust ... scorched and shaken by a
million years of volcanic activity ... covered
by a vast sea of molten rhyolite. The hot lava
slowly cooled and was in turn engulfed by
creeping rivers of blue-green glacial ice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>As this new ice age withdrew, countless sediment-bearing
streams roared down from the
melting glaciers and, aided by the bitter winds
of high places, began carving Yellowstone into
its present form.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="The Cathedrals are natural Gothic spires of hard stone that resisted erosion by the river when it carved the deep gorge of Gallatin Canyon. These formations are especially beautiful under a Montana moon." width="500" height="344" />

</div>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/p06a.jpg" alt="Man with camera." width="250" height="258" />
</div>
<p>Even today, Yellowstone is a &ldquo;young&rdquo; land
that is undergoing relatively rapid changes. The
subterranean heat that causes its geyser activity
is slowly subsiding.</p>
<p>Old geysers die out and new ones grow in
power and regularity. Imperceptibly, the canyons
deepen, and erosion carves new patterns
on rocky walls.</p>
<p>This is the land ... rich in forests and wild
life, and gemmed with sparkling mountain lakes
... that has been set aside for the perpetual
enjoyment of our people. This is Yellowstone,
oldest and greatest of America&rsquo;s National Parks.</p>
<p>Your trip to Yellowstone via The Milwaukee
Road takes you through the most spectacular
of all entrances&mdash;Gallatin Gateway.</p>
<p>You leave the train at Three Forks, Montana,
on the main transcontinental line of The Milwaukee
Road. Just outside of town the Gallatin,

<h3 id="c3">First Stop ... Geyserland</h3>
<p>One of the chief attractions of entering Yellowstone
via Gallatin Gateway is the 80 mile motor
trip through glorious mountain country that
you enjoy without extra charge.</p>
<p>Promptly after lunch, you leave Gallatin
Gateway Inn in one of the luxurious motor
coaches of the Yellowstone Park Company and
begin the trip southward.</p>
<p>In a short time you enter spectacular Gallatin
Canyon. Just beyond Roaring Creek lie the
huge, eroded battlements of Castle and Cathedral
Rocks, majestic cliffs that dwarf the tiny
river flowing swiftly at their base. This is the
famed Montana dude ranch country, and you
glimpse many of the ranches in the innumerable
little valleys that are tributary to the Gallatin.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see Sagebrush Point where the Gallatin
flows in a graceful S-curve hundreds of
feet below the road ... the broad cone of Lone
Mountain rising to a height of ten thousand
feet and Pulpit Rock, oddly and accurately
carved by some freak of Nature.</p>
<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;ll catch sight of a moose feeding
on lily roots in a pond beside the road, or a
band of elk emerging warily from the timber.
Over there is a new beaver dam, and that gray
shadow skirting the road is a coyote.</p>

</div>
<p>Crossing dozens of creeks with picturesque,
western names, you enter the boundaries of
Yellowstone. Again leaving the Park, the road
winds through the Madison National Forest,
skirts Hebgen Lake, crosses the Madison and
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
brings you to West Yellowstone&mdash;your official
entrance to the Park.</p>

<p>The Motor trip from Gallatin Gateway is a
perfect introduction to Yellowstone, and shows
you country unlike any within the Park.</p>
<h3 id="c4">Here Comes Old Faithful</h3>
<p>From West Yellowstone, the route follows the
Madison through Christmas Tree Park, and
then down the lovely valley of the Firehole
River into geyserland. There are more geysers
in Yellowstone than in all the rest of the world,
and the greatest of them are here in the Lower
and Upper Basins. The hiss of steam, low, subterranean
mutterings and the roar of geysers in
action make this landscape a scene from the
Inferno. You see Fountain, Great Fountain,
Riverside and Giant geysers, Morning Glory
Pool and Fountain Paint Pot, and reach Old
Faithful for dinner and the night.</p>
<p>The most famous geyser in the world, Old
Faithful may be depended upon to stage its
almost hourly shows for your special benefit.
Approximately every sixty-five minutes it growls
and hisses for a moment, and then leaps into
action sending its glorious plume of boiling
water 120 or more feet into the sky.</p>
<p>Old Faithful is a perfect spot for your first
stay in Yellowstone and offers a variety of attractions
that will make your time here seem
all too short. Besides the many nearby geysers,
you will see the iridescent turquoise of Morning
Glory Pool with its flower-tinted cone ... Black
Sand Pool and Sapphire Springs ... Firehole
Lake with its flame-like streamers of gas bubbling
to the surface, Chinaman Pool and numerous
other steaming pools and springs.</p>

</div>
<p>There is an enclosed swimming pool and a
museum. A variety of short walking trips may
be taken with the ranger-naturalists, and longer
trips made on horseback with colorful wranglers
who know the phenomena of the Park.</p>
<p>Old Faithful Inn itself is built wholly of
native materials. Within its friendly walls, you
dine, dance, play and meet congenial fellow
travelers before the great open fireplace.</p>
<p>The following day, your caravan moves on
from Old Faithful past the beautiful Kepler
Cascades of the Firehole, and over the Continental
Divide. Here is the Rocky Mountain
watershed that sends the rivers on one side flowing
down to the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico,
and on the other side, to the Pacific. To the south
lie Shoshone Lake and the snowy peaks of the
Teton range.</p>
<h3 id="c5">Lovely Yellowstone Lake</h3>
<p>At Thumb, the road descends to the shore of
Yellowstone Lake. 7,730 feet above sea level,
this huge lake covering more than 130 square
miles, is America&rsquo;s highest navigable body of
water. Past Fishing Cone, the road skirts the
shore of the Lake for many miles to the mouth
of the Yellowstone River. Many Yellowstone
visitors enjoy fishing or boating on the lake.</p>
<p>Big, hard-fighting trout of several species
inhabit the deep, perpetually cold waters of the
lake, and afford the finest kind of sport. Boats,
guides and fishing tackle are available.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig28">
<img src="images/p12a.jpg" alt="Here is part of the crowd clustered around Old Faithful as it nears time for an eruption. This famous geyser discharges with almost clock-like regularity at intervals of about 65 minutes." width="500" height="244" />
<p class="center"><i>Here is part of the crowd clustered around Old Faithful as it nears time for an eruption. This famous geyser discharges with almost clock-like regularity at intervals of about 65 minutes.</i></p>
</div>
<p>There are also a number of modern speedboats
that were painstakingly hauled up to the
lake. These mahogany beauties make regular
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
passenger trips and give a real thrill as they race
over the sparkling water. Yellowstone Lake
is one of the few places in America where you
may still see wild swans&mdash;the last survivors of
once-numerous flocks of these majestic birds.
Pelicans are plentiful on Molly Island.</p>

<p>But now our tour continues. Winding through
beautiful Hayden Valley, the road continues,
for the most part, close beside the Yellowstone
River and then past Mud Volcano. Soon we
cross over Chittenden Bridge, pass the Upper

Hotel that is superbly situated at the head of
the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.</p>

<h3 id="c6">Magnificently Colorful ... the Grand Canyon</h3>
<p>To many visitors, the Grand Canyon is the
highpoint of Yellowstone. And well it may be,
for the views from Artist or Inspiration Points
are scarcely rivaled in all the world. A third of
a mile wide and more than a thousand feet
deep, the mighty gorge has been fantastically
carved by the rushing waters of the Yellowstone
River. Ranging in tone from pale lemon to
tawny buff, the rock walls of the canyon are
splashed with a hundred shades of crimson,
blue and green&mdash;a glorious play of color that
changes hourly with the passage of the sun.
And far down at the bottom winds the jade
green ribbon of the Yellowstone. Muted by distance,
you hear the thunder of the Great Falls
where the river leaps out and down, 308 feet
into the gorge.</p>
<p>To those who have seen it, the Canyon remains
one of the scenic highlights of a lifetime.
Warm yet delicate in coloring, big but not so
big that it staggers the imagination, the gorge
is as perfect and complete as a flawless gem.</p>
<p>Leaving Canyon Hotel, you continue northward
through Dunraven Pass, where the road
climbs the shoulder of Mt. Washburn. If you
wish, you may take the more spectacular route
to the very summit of the 10,317 foot mountain
for the finest panorama of the Park.</p>
<p>Soon the road rejoins the Yellowstone River
and you see Tower Falls. Flowing down from
the high plateau, Tower Creek plunges down
a 132-foot drop to join the Yellowstone in its
long course eastward. Needle-like volcanic rocks
stand sentinel at the head of the falls and nearby
are strange buttresses of hard basalt forming
palisades as regular as if they had been cut
by man.</p>
<p>A little farther up the road is a forest of
petrified trees. These fallen giants of hard stone
reproduce, in astonishing detail and in a variety
of rich colors, the bark and wood fibers of which
they were once composed.</p>

<p>Depending on the gateway selected for exit
from the Park, schedules of Park tours vary
slightly. Complete itineraries for the various
tours are shown elsewhere in this book.</p>
<p>This brief summary is a far from complete
outline of what may be seen and done in Yellowstone.
You might profitably spend an entire
summer within the confines of the Park or&mdash;as
many do&mdash;come back repeatedly.</p>
<h3 id="c8">Wild Life in Abundance</h3>
<p>Yellowstone is a great wild animal refuge where
the game is protected and therefore quite unafraid
of humans. You will see dozens and
dozens of the famous bears whose clumsy antics
are an unfailing source of amusement. Among
them is the grizzly bear, rightfully the most
respected of all the wild animals. In meeting
bears on the roads and paths, never tease the
animals with food.</p>
<p>Almost anywhere in the Park you may catch
glimpses of deer, and perhaps of buffalo, antelope,
elk and mountain sheep as well as smaller
animals such as marmots, beaver and chipmunks.
You will have ample opportunity to
take short walking trips. You can fish and swim;
join community singing around huge campfires;
listen to lectures on the geology and animal life
of the Park; see informal entertainments by the
boys and girls who staff the lodges and hotels;
join in the fun of informal dances.</p>
<p>Whether you have little time or much, no
finer vacation spot exists than magnificent, incredible
Yellowstone. Boundless in wonders and
in hospitality, this is your Park, your playground
... the magic land where dreams come true.</p>

<h2 id="c11"><br /><span class="small">SUPER DOMES</span>
<br /><span class="smallest">NOW ON THE</span> <i><span class="smallest">OLYMPIAN</span> Hiawatha</i></h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s extra fun on your trip to Yellowstone
via The Milwaukee Road. The super-speed
Olympian <span class="sc">Hiawatha</span>&mdash;only one night en route
from Chicago&mdash;carries America&rsquo;s first full length
domes, the only domes to the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>68 individual lookout seats on the upper deck
provide glorious views of the palisades of the
Mississippi, the Belt Mountains, Montana Canyon
and the source of the Missouri near Three
Forks. Delightful Cafe Lounge on the lower
deck of the Super Dome car for beverages and
snacks. Entire car is open to all passengers.</p>
<p>Olympian <span class="sc">Hiawatha</span> equipment includes
private-room cars with the unique Skytop
Lounge. Double bedrooms and roomettes are
completely and luxuriously appointed. Adjoining
bedrooms open to form connecting suites.</p>
<p>Touralux sleepers, built exclusively for this
service, offer berth comfort and privacy at reduced
cost. Reserved seat Luxurest coaches
have 40 individual chairs with leg rests; spacious
lounge-dressing rooms for men and for women.
Dining car features famous Milwaukee Road
meals. All cars are air conditioned and wired
for radio or station announcements.</p>
<h3 id="c12">The electrified COLUMBIAN</h3>
<p>Accommodations in air conditioned standard
Pullman sleepers, tourist sleepers and Hiawatha-type
coaches. Electric operation through the
Belt Mountains and Montana Canyon.</p>
<p>Westbound passengers for Yellowstone on the
<span class="sc">Columbian</span> reach Three Forks in the morning,
have lunch at Gallatin Gateway Inn and leave
for the Park immediately afterward. On the
Olympian <span class="sc">Hiawatha</span>, you reach Three Forks
in mid-afternoon and remain at the Inn until
after lunch the following day. By eliminating
the stay at the Inn, you save money traveling
on the <span class="sc">Columbian</span>. There is also some saving
of time from Chicago despite the more leisurely
schedule of this train.</p>

<h2 id="c13"><br /><span class="small">GENERAL INFORMATION</span></h2>
<h3 id="c14">Prepaid, All-Expense Tours Personally Escorted</h3>
<p>Many Yellowstone Park travelers prefer to travel with
special parties of congenial people under the popular all-expense
plan. These tours will be operated during the Yellowstone
Park season and those desiring to join one of the
parties should call on any of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St.
Paul and Pacific Railroad travel bureaus shown on the inside
back cover of this booklet or write direct to Mr. H.
Sengstacken, Passenger Traffic Manager, The Milwaukee
Road, Union Station, Chicago 6, Ill.</p>
<h3 id="c15">The Park Season</h3>
<p>The regular Park season is June 22nd to September 8th.</p>
<h3 id="c16">Motor Transportation</h3>
<p>The Yellowstone Park Company, under contract with the
Government operates a transportation line between the
Park entrances and the various hotels and points of interest.</p>
<h3 id="c17">Hotels</h3>
<p>All service is under the supervision of the Government
and is maintained at a high standard at rates fixed by
the Government.</p>
<p>Each hotel is individual in character and architecture,
completely and modernly equipped.</p>
<p>Old Faithful Inn is a striking structure of logs and stone.
Its unusual lobby is 75 feet square and 92 feet high to the
peak of the roof, with balconies around three sides.</p>
<p>Old Faithful Geyser is nearby the Inn, and not far away
are many other geysers too numerous to mention here.</p>
<p>The Canyon Hotel, one of the finest hotels in the country
with every comfort and convenience, is particularly well
known for its spacious and beautiful plate-glass enclosed
lounge. It has a wonderful setting high up on one side of
Yellowstone Canyon, not far from the Lower Falls.</p>
<p>Mammoth Hot Springs hotel is most modern in style
and appointments.</p>
<h3 id="c18">The Climate</h3>
<p>Far from the least attraction of an invigorating outing
is the climate. An average elevation of 8,000 feet brings a
clear and bracing atmosphere. Hot mineral baths and outdoor
sleeping, best of Nature&rsquo;s medicines, may be enjoyed
throughout the season. During the tourist season the mean
average temperature ranges from 54&deg; to 64&deg; with a maximum
of 88&deg;. There is little choice as to the best time for visiting
the Park. Early summer finds more snow in the mountains;
August and September bring floral decorations in all their
beauty and charm.</p>
<h3 id="c19">What to Wear</h3>
<p>Warm clothing should be worn, and one should be prepared
for sudden changes of temperature common at an
altitude of 7,500 feet. Men should have medium weight
overcoats and sweaters, and women should have coats or
sweaters. Slacks or riding breeches are recommended for
both men and women. Stout shoes should be worn as they
are most comfortable and best suited for walking about the
geysers, terraces and other formations. Tinted glasses,
serviceable gloves and field glasses will be found useful.</p>
<h3 id="c20">Park Administration</h3>
<p>Yellowstone, like all other National Parks, is under the
supervision of the National Park Service, with a local
superintendent located at Mammoth Hot Springs, headquarters
of the Park administration.</p>
<h3 id="c21">Church Services</h3>
<p>Religious services are conducted at convenient locations
in the park. Information provided at hotel desks.</p>
<h3 id="c22">Medical Service in Yellowstone</h3>
<p>Physicians and surgeons with headquarters at Mammoth
Hot Springs are available for call to any place in the Park.
Trained nurses and a dispensary are at each of the hotels
in the Park. At Mammoth is a well-equipped hospital with
skilled personnel.</p>
<h3 id="c23">Saddle Horse Trips and Guides</h3>
<p>Saddle horses, as well as competent guides, are available
at all hotels and lodges at established rates made by the
National Park Service. Those who desire to do so may get
far off the beaten path and into the more remote and scenic
regions of the Park.</p>
<h3 id="c24">Cost of Park Tour from Gallatin Gateway</h3>

<h3 id="c25">Baggage</h3>
<p>The Yellowstone Park Company will carry free, two
pieces of hand baggage for each person, not to exceed sixty
pounds in total weight, with a limited liability of $25.00 for
each piece for loss or damage. Passengers desiring additional
protection may obtain an insurance policy at small cost
from the transportation agent at Gallatin Gateway. Trunks
cannot be transported in the automobiles. Tourists contemplating
a prolonged trip through the Park can make
arrangements with representatives of the Transportation
Company at Gallatin Gateway for the forwarding of trunks.</p>
<p>Railroads store baggage free at Gallatin Gateway, Three
Forks, Butte, Livingston, Gardiner, Cody, Frannie or
Billings, West Yellowstone, Pocatello, Idaho Falls, Ogden
or Salt Lake City, for actual length of time spent in the
Park. Baggage may be checked to Gallatin Gateway,
Gardiner, Cody or West Yellowstone.</p>

<p><i>Passengers entering the Park via one station and leaving via another can
make arrangements for free checking of baggage to station via which they leave
the Park.</i></p>

<h2 id="c26"><br /><span class="small">Return via Salt Lake City and Colorado</span></h2>
<p>Many rail travelers from the East and Middle West add to
the enjoyment of their Yellowstone tour by returning over
a different route. You can plan your trip to continue southward
from West Yellowstone to Salt Lake City, then east
through Colorado and so home again.</p>
<p>Salt Lake City, originally settled and built by the Mormons,
is a clean and attractive city that rates high in
tourist interest. The focal point, of course, is the great
square containing the handsome Mormon Temple and the
smaller Tabernacle with its barrel-vaulted, wooden roof.
Organ recitals are held regularly in this building.</p>
<p>Many brief tours are available to points of outstanding
interest. You will want to visit Saltair on the shores of
Great Salt Lake and probably to take a swim in the amazingly
buoyant waters. You also see the vast and arid salt
fields on this trip. Another tour might well be through
Bingham Canyon into the mining country where you see
the world&rsquo;s largest open pit copper mine.</p>
<p>From Salt Lake City, one of the routes east takes you
through the world-renowned Royal Gorge of the Arkansas
River, one of the great scenic thrills of the West. Another
scenic route east takes you through Cheyenne.</p>
<p>From Colorado Springs, the &ldquo;Sunshine City&rdquo;, motor
tours take you through the beautiful residential section
and over High Mesa to the colorful Garden of the Gods.
Then on to Manitou, Seven Falls, Cheyenne Mountain,
the Will Rogers Shrine Memorial, through Ute Pass and
up Pyramid Mountain for a superb view of Pikes Peak
and its sisters in the Rockies.</p>
<p>Denver, the mile-high city, has a superb system of
parks, the Buffalo Bill Memorial Museum and the tomb
of Buffalo Bill. Scenic drives offer extraordinary views
into Clear Creek Canyon, Bear Creek Canyon and the
gorgeous Red Rocks.</p>
<p>Fast streamliners provide excellent rail service between
Denver, Colorado Springs and Chicago.</p>
